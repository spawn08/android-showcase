## Application Scope

The `android-showcase` displays information about music albums. The data is loaded from the
[Last.fm Music Discovery API](https://www.last.fm/api).

The app has a few screens located in multiple feature modules:

- Album list screen - displays list of albums
- Album detail screen - display information about the selected album
- Profile screen - empty (WiP)
- Favourites screen - empty (WiP)

## Architecture

By dividing a problem into smaller and easier to solve sub-problems, we can reduce the complexity of designing and
maintaining a large system. Each module is independent build-block serving a clear purpose. We can think about each
feature as the reusable component, equivalent of [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) or private
library.

The modularized code-base approach provides a few benefits:

- reusability - enable code sharing and building multiple apps from the same foundation. Apps should be a sum of their
- features where the features are organized as separate modules.
- [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) - each module has a clear API.
  Feature-related classes live in different modules and can't be referenced without explicit module dependency. We
  strictly control what is exposed to other parts of your codebase.
- features can be developed in parallel eg. by different teams
- each feature can be developed in isolation, independently from other features
- faster build time

### Module Types And Module Dependencies

This diagram presents dependencies between project modules (Gradle sub-projects).

![module_dependencies](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/module_dependencies.png?raw=true)

We have three kinds of modules in the application:

- `app` module - this is the main module. It contains code that wires multiple modules together (class, dependency
  injection setup, `NavHostActivity`, etc.) and fundamental application configuration (retrofit configuration, required
  permissions setup, custom `Application` class, etc.).
- `feature_x` modules - the most common type of module containing all code related to a given feature.
  share some assets or code only between `feature` modules (currently app has no such modules)
- `feature_base` modules that features modules depend on to share a common code.

### Feature Module Structure

`Clean Architecture` is implemented at module level - each module contains its own set of Clean Architecture layers:

![module_dependencies_layers](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/module_dependencies_layers.png?raw=true)

> Notice that the `app` module and `library_x` modules structure differs a bit from the feature module structure.

Each feature module contains non-layer components and 3 layers with a distinct set of responsibilities.

![feature_structure](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/feature_structure.png?raw=true)

#### Presentation Layer

This layer is closest to what the user sees on the screen.

The `presentation` layer mixes `MVVM` and `MVI` patterns:

- `MVVM` - Jetpack `ViewModel` is used to encapsulate `common UI state`. It exposes the `state` via observable state
  holder (`Kotlin Flow`)
- `MVI` - `action` modifies the `common UI state` and emits a new state to a view via `Kotlin Flow`

> `common state` is a single source of truth for each view. This solution derives from
> [Unidirectional Data Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_Data_Flow_(computer_science)) and [Redux
> principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles).

This approach facilitates creation of consistent states. State is collected via `collectAsUiStateWithLifecycle`
method. Flows collection happens in a lifecycle-aware manner, so
[no resources are wasted](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/consuming-flows-safely-in-jetpack-compose-cde014d0d5a3).

Stated is annotated with [Immutable](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Immutable)
annotation that is used by Jetpack compose to enable composition optimizations.

Components:

- **View (Fragment)** - observes common view state (through `Kotlin Flow`). Compose transform state (emitted by Kotlin
  Flow) into application UI Consumes the state and transforms it into application UI (via `Jetpack Compose`). Pass user
  interactions to `ViewModel`. Views are hard to test, so they should be as simple as possible.
- **ViewModel** - emits (through `Kotlin Flow`) view state changes to the view and deals with user interactions (these
  view models are not simply [POJO classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object)).
- **ViewState** - common state for a single view
- **StateTimeTravelDebugger** - logs actions and view state transitions to facilitate debugging.
- **NavManager** - singleton that facilitates handling all navigation events inside `NavHostActivity` (instead of
  separately, inside each view)

#### Domain Layer

This is the core layer of the application. Notice that the `domain` layer is independent of any other layers. This
allows making domain models and business logic independent from other layers. In other words, changes in other layers
will not affect `domain` layer eg. changing the database (`data` layer) or screen UI (`presentation` layer) ideally will
not result in any code change withing the `domain` layer.

Components:

- **UseCase** - contains business logic
- **DomainModel** - defines the core structure of the data that will be used within the application. This is the source
  of truth for application data.
- **Repository interface** - required to keep the `domain` layer independent from
  the `data layer` ([Dependency inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)).

#### Data Layer

Manages application data. Connect to data sources and provide data through repository to the `domain` layer eg. retrieve
data from the internet and cache the data in disk cache (when device is offline).

Components:

- **Repository** is exposing data to the `domain` layer. Depending on the application structure and quality of the
  external APIs repository can also merge, filter, and transform the data. These operations intend to create
  high-quality data source for the `domain` layer.
- **Mapper** - maps `data model` to `domain model` (to keep `domain` layer independent from the `data` layer).

Data layer contains implicit layer called `Data source` containing all components involved with data manipulation of a
given data source. Application has two data sources - `Retrofit` (network) and `Room` (local storage):

- **Retrofit Service** - defines a set of API endpoints
- **Retrofit Response Model** - definition of the network objects for given endpoint (top-level model for the data
  consists of `ApiModels`)
- **Retrofit Api Data Model** - defines the network objects (sub-objects of the `Response Model`)
- **Room Database** - persistence database to store app data
- **Room DAO** - interact with the stored data
- **Room Entity** - definition of the stored objects

Both `Retrofit API Data Models` and `Room Entities` contain annotations, so given framework understands how to parse the
data into objects.

### Data Flow

The below diagram presents application data flow when a user interacts with the `album list screen`:

![app_data_flow](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/app_data_flow.png?raw=true)

## Dependency Management

Gradle [versions catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:version-catalog) is used as a
centralized dependency management third-party dependency coordinates (group, artifact, version) are shared across all
modules (Gradle projects and subprojects).

All of the dependencies are stored in the [libs.versions.toml](./gradle/libs.versions.toml) file (default location).
The [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file consists of a few major sections:

- `[versions]` - declare versions that can be referenced by all dependencies
- `[libraries]` - declare the aliases to library coordinates
- `[bundles]` - declare dependency bundles (groups)
- `[plugins]` - declare Gradle plugin dependencies

Each feature module depends on the `feature_base` module, so dependencies are shared without the need to add them
explicitly in each feature module.

Project enables the `TYPESAFE_PROJECT_ACCESSORS` experimental Gradle feature to generate type safe accessors to refer
other projects.

```kotlin
// Before
implementation(project(":feature_album"))

// After
implementation(projects.featureAlbum)
```

## Logcat debuggins

To facilitate debuting project contains logs. You can filter logs understand app flow. Keywords:
- `onCreate` see what `Activities` and `Fragements` have been created
- `Action` - filter all actions performed on the screens to update the UI
- `Http` - debug network requests and responses

## CI Pipeline

CI is utilizing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Complete GitHub Actions config is located in
the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) folder.

### Pull Request Verification

Series of workflows run (in parallel) for every opened PR and after merging PR to the `main` branch:

* `./gradlew lintDebug` - runs Android lint
* `./gradlew detektCheck` - runs detekt and ktlint
* `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` - run unit tests
* `./gradlew connectedCheck` - run UI tests
* `./gradlew :app:bundleDebug` - create app bundle
